Inspiration
===========
What is different between online store and offline store? It is not just only physical goods but also the shopkeeper. In the past, when you go to video rental store, you can ask the shopkeeper to recommend a new movie for you. The shopkeeper remembers  movies you rent in the past, what is your favourite movie and what is your dislike movie. So he can suggests a new movie for you to rent.

Now, when you what to watch a movie online, who will recommend a movie for you? You may read several movie reviews on websites and blogs. But do reviewer teste similiar to you? And will every movie are reviewed?

Solution
========
We create the small artificial intelligent to observer user behavior and lean which movie user love to watch. We use a huge database to store a ton of data and pick up the right movies and shown up to the user in the recommendation section.
